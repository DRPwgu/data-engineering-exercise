# Fender Digital Data Engineering Exercise

Design and implement a data pipeline that that pulls data about books and authors for a topic you are interested in using [Open Library.](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) It is suggested that you leverage the [search api](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search) to limit your results. As an output of this exercise we expect to see a minimum of the following:

1. Python program that pulls data from the rest api
2. CSV files for the following:
	* Authors
	* Books
	* Authors and Books (a bridge table between the previous entities)
3. DDL to create a hypothetical database schema ( you don't have to create a DB but you are welcome to)

The objective of this exercise is to have you walk us through a solution you have created. Do as much or as little as you would like.
